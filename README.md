# Motion Detection System

A real-time motion detection application using OpenCV's background subtraction. Detects movement from webcam feed and highlights moving objects with bounding boxes.

## Features

- Real-time motion detection using MOG2 background subtraction
- Adjustable sensitivity for motion detection
- Visual feedback with bounding boxes around moving objects
- Option to save snapshots when motion is detected
- Ability to reset background model during operation
- Displays both original frame and foreground mask

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
- Numpy

## Installation
